When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would like to use a remote repository when completing a logical unit of work in a collaborative project.  

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I would have more control of the final versions.  Let's imagine that me and other developer started to work on a project and we both edited the same block of code.  Then a conflict would arise, and I would need to fix it in order to have a final working version for the last commit of the project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    When a developer clones a repository from GitHub they are creating a local copy of that file.  In other words,
    is the same thingas of having clicked the zip and download button on GitHub.  A branch are different version of the project.  Last,   a fork is used when I want to copy a repository that is available in GitHub to my GitHub profile.  Its a direct  remote copy of 
    the file, it is not being downloaded to my local computer.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
